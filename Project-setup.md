EOS depends on Strapi for the configuration of the project and content management. We use GraphQL with Strapi to query our data. You can find more at the [Strapi](https://strapi.io/documentation/3.x.x/getting-started/quick-start.html#_5-consume-the-api) documentation and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) Documentation

To setup EOS please follow the steps in our temporary documentation https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MB8LfV8eq96cPy7NDRKMkN1TT6gG1bkyfunnEaTGUrg/edit#

NOTE: We're working on a better documentation.
