### Design process:

All design cards should follow the full design process as described below:

1. **Research and implement an initial draft or wireframe:** It is important that this initial step is not skipped since it will be our chance to gather information for the main text, elements and structure of the page. A draft/wireframe could normally NOT include colors or final styling. The main objective is to learn as soon as possible and invest as little time as possible designing since after having gathered feedback, the wireframe will most likely need to apply changes. Prototyping at this step is also a valid option so your reviewers understand better the path you defined.

(Normally made using digital tools like: sketch, Adobe XD, or even photoshop)

(Normally made with pen and paper or on whiteboard)

2. **Learn from your mistakes and design in high-definition:** After having implemented the changes the team suggested you in the previous step, and only after the draft/wireframe has been approved or all issues are marked as resolved, your idea is on the right track and you can now invest time on colors, shades, and the final look of your idea. With this, comes prototyping your idea as well, using the high definition mockups you need to now provide a prototype
