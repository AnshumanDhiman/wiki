### Design process:

All design cards should follow the full design process as described below:

1. **Research and implement an initial draft or wireframe:** It is important that this initial step is not skipped since it will be our chance to gather information for the main text, elements and structure of the page. A draft/wireframe could normally NOT include colors or final styling. The main objective is to learn as soon as possible and invest as little time as possible designing since after having gathered feedback, the wireframe will most likely need to apply changes.
