Structuring our Sass files is important, since it will help us to keep a cleaner, more consistent and reusable code. Keeping a structured mindset when defining our CSS will help us avoid technical debt in the near future.
We structure our CSS files is inspired by the [SMACSS](https://smacss.com) convention but also other patterns, such as the [7-1 pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern).

## Our current Sass structure explained
We have the following folders:
* base
* components
* helpers

* layout
