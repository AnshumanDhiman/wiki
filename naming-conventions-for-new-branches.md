# Using the slash character in Git branch name

When creating a new branch in git, you need to use the slash character to separate the **Theme** / **name-of-branch**.
By **Theme** we mean you need to use one of the 6th different themes (or Trello labels) the EOS roadmap uses: https://trello.com/b/PauX7Rel/eos-roadmap-backlog.
They are:
1. UX
2. UI
3. Operations
4. Engagement
5. Training
6. Front-end

This theme will be easy for you to find out since it will be part of the card you are working on. If the card you are working on has no theme, then this card is not properly following the **Definition of Ready** and it should be moved back to the backlog column **New cards**
