We use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) to track the EOS website. Analytics is added to the page by using [Google's Tag Manager](http://tagmanager.google.com/)

## Google Tag Manager
Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a tag management system created by Google to manage JavaScript and HTML tags used for tracking and analytics on websites. It listens for events in the page and is able to insert these tags where needed. Its great advantage is that no coding is required in order to add such scripts as it is all handled by GTM itself.

### Prevent internal traffic from appearing in Google Analytics
In order to prevent internal traffic (our own visits) we will use a [Chrome add-on](https://goo.gl/1YFNP7). All that is needed is to activate it when loading our [heroku instance](http://eos-test.herokuapp.com/)
