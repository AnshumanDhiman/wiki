# Welcome to the EOS project wiki

This Wiki defines the Design System used to deliver UX, UI, front-end, and other deliverables for the EOS project found at https://gitlab.com/SUSE-UIUX/eos

## EOS product vision

*A living, open, and customizable Design System for front-end developers and UX designers at SUSE and SMEs to efficiently deliver and implement industry-standard practices that will help brands achieve consistency and success.*

## EOS Design System, what is it actually?

- The EOS Design System is not limited to 1 specific product or a set of them. Instead, to **any product** in a given organization. This means that the results of EOS can be implemented in either existing and upcoming products.
- EOS is a Design System, that means, a set of components, guides, and definitions to help designers and front-end developers design their interfaces efficiently and consistently. 
- Features in a product are, normally, a set of components together to provide functionality for a certain website following specific use cases and scenarios. EOS doesn't provide features, but components. The product's designers/front-end dev take care of assembling the components into features.
- Read the product mission statement to understand the scope of the product: https://eos-mission.webflow.io/
