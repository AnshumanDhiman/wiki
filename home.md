# Welcome to the EOS project wiki

The following documentation defines the Design System used to deliver UX, UI, front-end, and other deliverables required in the product roadmap of the EOS project found at: https://trello.com/b/PauX7Rel/eos-roadmap-backlog

## EOS project vision:

*A living Design System, for front-end developers and UI designers, to efficiently improve the quality and consistency of SUSE products*

## EOS Design System, what is it actually?

- The EOS Design System does is not limited to 1 specific product or a set of them. Instead, to **any SUSE product**. This means that the results of EOS can be implemented in either existing and upcoming products.
- EOS is a Design System, that means, a set of components, guides, and definitions to help designers and front-end developers design their interfaces efficiently and consistently. 
- Features in a product are, normally, a set of components together to provide a functionality for a certain website following specific use cases and scenarios. EOS doesn't provide features, but components. The product's designers/front-end dev take care of assembling the components into features.
