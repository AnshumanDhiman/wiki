When using Photoshop to create a document that will present the user interface of a certain product based on the UX/UI Guideline some rule must be respected, in order to create documents consistent with each other and compatible with our workflow and tools. Here’s the list:

**1) Creating a new photoshop document**
When creating a new document Photoshop will propose to chose among different format,
the one to chose is “Web” since it has “Art boards”,  chose a width of 1366x768 pixels @72 ppi, RGB.
In case the height of the document is not enough for a certain project it’s possible to increase it, but only on a specific artboard and not to the whole document.

**2) Artboards**
Each page will be displayed on a different Artboard. 
Artboards need to be always named, the more specific you are the better it is since InVision and other softwares generate screens from artboards and name them the same way the are named in Photoshop.

**3) Layers**
Layers should always be named with the name of the description and the kind of object
for example “home Icon”

**4) Folders**
- Each layers have always have to be put inside a folder, the folder should group objects inside the same area. For example the folder “header” will contains all the layer that contain objects that lays inside the header area. 
- Inside the header folder there will be subfolders that will group layers that compose a the same object. For example the username and the icon next to it will be grouped in the same subfolder.
- Folders have to be always named.

**5) Smart objects**
Certain elements like Heather or Footer will repeat on every artboard, to facilitate the process and to be able to apply changes all at once for every artboards the best way is to use “Smart Object”.
Therefore common elements will be converted in “Smart Object” and insert into a specific library  so that they can be replicate in a fast way, without error, and once a change is applied it will apply to all the documents and artboards that use that Smart Object.

*that also means to use very carefully existing smart objects since they may affect not only the document you’re working on, but also other file from different team member.*

**6) Colors**
We will use color labels on folders and layers to communicate a state of an element ( folder or layer )using the following scheme:
RED = the element is already defined don’t change it.
GRAY = an experiment, just a test
GREEN = work in progress
YELLOW = ready for review
BLUE = just a place holder
VIOLET = need to be changed

**7) Libraries**
All the common elements will be stored in our Adobe shared library for a faster and always consisted design production. 
The elements are:
- Colors
- Logos
- Character styles
- Smart Objects
- Graphic objects
- Icons

**8) Layers modification**
Never rasterize a layer and always chose effect in line with the possibilities 

**9) Location of the file**
All the file need to be stored in a location where all the team have easy access to.
