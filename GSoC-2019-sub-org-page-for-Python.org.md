# About EOS Design System

Many companies of all different sizes struggle with today's IT agendas: bleeding edge software, agile development, short time-to-market, etc., and this "new" (and really not so) kid on the block is not making it any easier for developer and designers to keep up: UX design. 

Design Systems can help solve this problem, and a few more. Design Systems serve as a centralized source of information for UX, UI, and other brand-related guidelines that help not only developers find the UI element or component they need, but also designers to build faster prototypes while streamlining the collaboration between the two.

At EOS, we are creating the first open source and customizable Design System to help open source, SMEs, and all types of organizations deliver outstanding user interfaces, and consistent user experience cross-products by the hand of the current industry standards.

EOS also created an iconic font made specifically to fit more complex scenarios seen in more technical OSS, as for example: endpoints_disconnected, file_system, repositories, proxy, and some other icons not found in the most popular and open source iconic fonts out there.

Our project relies upon several open source technologies:
Node.js, Express.js, Fontforge, Strapi CMS, Bootstrap 4, Pug.js, and others.

# Project 2

**Project Title:** Customizable icons font


# Project 2

**Project Title:** Web UI builder

**Description:** EOS Design System is an open source set of guidelines, components, elements, and more. All these tools are there to help developers and designers create products in a consistent and efficient way. The goal of a Design System is that all products in a portfolio look and feel the same in order to enhance the user experience and brand perception. While a good documentation of all these components help designers and developers understand how and when to use them, nothing could make their life easier than enabling developers and designers to create quick mockups in an online web UI builder that use the exact color, size, and shape of the UI block defined in the design system.

There is already an open source web builder available: https://github.com/artf/grapesjs. You can checkout the demo at: https://grapesjs.com/demo.html. And several other proprietary builders:
https://www.layoutit.com/build, https://pingendo.com/
Use the examples above to get the best ideas for the UI builder, keeping in mind that we expect a more minimal result given the size of a project like that, so you will need to plan this accordingly. We will help you.

EOS follows the Atomic Design process for building UI blocks:

If you want to understand more about Atomic Design, I recommend you reading the following article: https://medium.muz.li/building-design-systems-with-atomic-design-93a13286f676

**Deliverable:** The main objective of this project is to deliver a basic web UI builder that can easily register new UI elements, and that can export mockups (perhaps just a PDF or screenshot at first).

**Mentor:** Cynthia Sanchez. Co-mentor: Sorin Curescu.

**Skills:** Node.js, Express.js, CI, Angular/React/Backbone, Pug.js, SCSS, Bootstrap 4, Heroku.

**Skill Level:** Medium

**Get started:** Research and test the waters first. Grapesjs may not be the only open source available solution. Start small and keep a close communication gap with your mentors, we are entirely available for you. Your success is our main priority.
