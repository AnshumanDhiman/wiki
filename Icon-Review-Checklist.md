It is important that each icon pull-request is reviewed properly before merging. Use the checklist below to ensure that each pull-request can be merged.

1. Clone or download the pull-request branch in order to view the file locally. Do not view the icon in the browser!

1. Check two see that the name of the icon follows the [icon naming rules](https://gitlab.com/SUSE-UIUX/eos/wikis/Designing-and-compiling-svg-icons#naming-conventions-for-icons-files).

1. Check to see that the .ai original file is properly saved in the [correct repository] (https://github.com/SUSE/eos-backup). Open the .ai file to ensure that it is the correct original motive.

1. Check to see if the icon fits the description of it's purpose in the trello card for each specific icon.

1. Check to see if there are any existing material or Eos icons which use a similar visual metaphor.

1. Check that the icon is front-facing and fits with the other material and Eos icons.

1. Check whether icon forms and lines can be simplified.

1. Check that the icon canvas is 24p high and 24px wide and that there are 2 empty pixels on all sides of the icon.

1. Check that lines and shapes are aligned to the grid and, where applicable, the keyline shapes (the squares, rectangles, and circle visible in the grid).

1. Check to see that the grid is not visible in the icon.

1. Check to see that all or most-all lines are 2px in thickness. If any line is less than 2px thick it should only use geometric forms which other icons are based upon.

1. Check to see that any outer corners (fillets) have a 2px radius. 

1. Check to see that the ends of lines are not rounded.

1. Check to see that none of the interior corners are rounded.

1. Discuss any exceptions to the rules above with the submitter in the pull-request itself. Exceptions are allowed but should stay in the minority or they are no longer exceptions but rather become the rule.
