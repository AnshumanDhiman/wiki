## Material Icons

The [Google Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/) provide the base upon which we build our icon set. 

[Google provides a guide](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) for attaining and using the Material Icons in various formats and contexts.

All icons are created in SVG format. There should only be one path and no groups (the SVG format does not allow for layers).


### Design

When creating icons it is important to first ensure that no icon already exists for this purpose. It is equally important to not re-use an existing icon for a different purpose.

All icons should follow Googles' [Guide for Creating System Icons](https://material.io/guidelines/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons).

All additional icons "live" in the Adobe Illustrator File for Icons(NAME/LINK!?) so if you have designed your icon on it's own please be sure to add it to the rest upon completion. Also, be sure to add the icon to the list of additional icons - when doing so please fill out all fields with the proper information about the icon you've created.

### Exceptions make the Rule

Please note that we do **not** follow Googles suggested colour/opacity for the various icon states but rather adhere to the EOS Colour Palette [to be defined in a later stage].
