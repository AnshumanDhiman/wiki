## Material Icons

The [Google Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/) provide the base upon which we build our icon set. 

Google has provided a guide for using the Material Icons in various formats and contexts:

### Design

When creating icons it is important to first ensure that no icon already exists for this purpose. It is equally important to not re-use an existing icon for a different purpose.

All icons should follow Googles' [Guide for Creating System Icons](https://material.io/guidelines/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons)

### Exceptions make the Rule
