# Material Icons

The [Google Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/) provide the base upon which we build our icon set. 

All icons are created in SVG format. There should only be one path and no groups (the SVG format does not allow for layers).


## Design

When creating icons it is important to first ensure that no icon already exists for this purpose. It is equally important to not re-use an existing icon for a different purpose.

All icons should follow Googles' [Guide for Creating System Icons](https://material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html).

All additional icons "live" in the Gitlab repository: https://gitlab.com/SUSE-UIUX/eos-icons.

## File name

The .svg file name should not contain the name "eos" or "eos-" but the actual name of the icon, as the compiler will automatically add "eos-" to all icons, please follow the naming conventions: https://gitlab.com/SUSE-UIUX/eos/wikis/Adobe-design-file-versioning-and-naming

## Exceptions make the Rule

Please note that we do **not** follow Googles suggested colour/opacity for the various icon states but rather adhere to the EOS Colour Palette [to be defined in a later stage].

## Exporting SVG from Adobe Illustrator

- Use "Export for screens"
