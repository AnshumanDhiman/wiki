## Material Icons

The [Google Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/) provide the base upon which we build our icon set. 

[Google provides a guide](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) for attaining and using the Material Icons in various formats and contexts.


### Design

When creating icons it is important to first ensure that no icon already exists for this purpose. It is equally important to not re-use an existing icon for a different purpose.

All icons should follow Googles' [Guide for Creating System Icons](https://material.io/guidelines/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons).

### Exceptions make the Rule

Please note that we do **not** follow Googles suggested colour/opacity for the various icon states but rather adhere to the [SUSE Colour Palette](LINK_NEEDED).
