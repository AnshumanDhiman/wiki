# Choosen library:

https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-webfont

## Decision made with the team

- Icons will leave in a separate repository: https://gitlab.com/SUSE-UIUX/eos-icons
- We will work merging into 1 branch per release. Once the icons are all ready, the branch will merge into master.
- The building will happen in the eos-icons branch, and EOS will only consume the icons, just the same way any other SUSE product will.
- In the EOS we will provide code spinnets showing how to use the icons library, since the icons use ligatures, there is no need to provide stylesheets.
- In the eos-icons repo, there will be a demo HTML for people to see the icons library. This demo is automatically generated by Grunt, we don't need to style it or improve anything in it.
- The download link will not trigger any zip download from the eos website but it will merely be an external link to the github repo https://gitlab.com/SUSE-UIUX/eos-icons

### Investigations:

**1)** gulp-iconfont 
URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-iconfont

**Problems:** 
- It requires Gulp, which we dont use. To use it we would have to invest extra time configuring and maintaining a gulp builder. 
- No option for ligature

**Good:** 
- Has plenty of daily downloads which means: more chances it is well maintained.

**Evaluation:** 2/5


**2)** iconfont-maker
URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconfont-maker

**Problems:** 

- Doesn export less (we dont need it)
- Doesnt accept ligatures
- Only a few downloads a week. Doesnt seem to be a popular library.

**Good:** 

- Npm package we can manipulate in nodejs or perhaps simply as a script in package.json
- Exports scss

**Evaluation:** 1/5

**3)** svg-font-create
URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-font-create

**Problems:**

- The library is old and it was last updated 4 years ago. 
- Outdated dependencies.

**Evaluation:** 1/5

**4)** icon-font-generator
URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/icon-font-generator

**Problems:**

- Cant process LESS/SCSS  (we dont need it)
- Cant create ligatures

**Good:**

- Accepts multiple (single icon) svg files
- Npm package we can manipulate in nodejs or perhaps simply as a script in package.json.

**Evaluation:** 2/5

**5)** svgicons2svgfont
URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/svgicons2svgfont

**Problems:**

- Doesnt take care of CSS, at all

**Good:**

- It seems to be the original module all others are integrating inside.
- Popular library.
- Last updated 1 month ago.
- Handles multiple svg files.
- Extracts ligatures from the file name. (couldnt make it work)
- If an icon has shapes not merged into 1 path, it will take care of merging them.
- From this project come the following options:

a) https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-webfont

**Problems:**

- We dont use Grunt in any project (no actual experience within the team) and it seems a bit pointless to have it only for 1 task.

**Good:**

- Can export css, sass, scss or less.
- Popular enough and well maintained.
- Exports HTML demo page.
- Supports ligatures with fontforge (default engine).

b) https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-webfont

Same as the one above, but made for Gulp. +1

**Good:**

- Can export css, sass, scss or less.
- Popular enough and well maintained.
- Exports HTML demo page.
- Supports ligatures with fontforge (default engine).
