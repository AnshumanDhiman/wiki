### Investigations:

**1)** gulp-iconfont 
URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-iconfont
**Problems:** 
- It requires Gulp, which we dont use. To use it we would have to invest extra time configuring and maintaining a gulp builder. 
- Requires svg in 500min height, contrary to our icon design guidelines, which would mean extra work exporting designing in 24px but exporting to 500px.
- No option for ligature

**Good:** 
- Has plenty of daily downloads which means: more chances it is well maintained.

**Evaluation:** 2/5
